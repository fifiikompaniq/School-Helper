# School Helper
 Using the mail of a user, take assignments from Google Classroom and put them in Google Calendar.
 The whole information comes from emails, sent by specific people, and by specifying the emails or names the program to track 
 we are able to take out enough information to add a title, description, due date and etc. to our calendar. 

# Features
 In the future, the program should be a bit more automatized and featuring auto-saving materials, keeping track of whether and assignment is done and therefore, removing   it from a to-do list, a more user-friendly GUI and etc.
